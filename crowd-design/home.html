<!--

Simply put, this is my understanding of how meteor works.

1. Define templates. These are reusable chunks of HTML that can by dynamically loaded with your own stuff,
whether it's as simple as model information in a model/viewmodel style or really more complicated setups where
a template has elements that know how to run javascript and then dynamically load their own templates.

Essentially though, you create a template, and then figure out how this template exists in a data context. For example,
you could make a really simple template that just shows an h1 element, and the h1 element could say something like
<h1>{{name}}</h1>

In this situation, the double brackets tells Meteor to go running and figure out what the name is. If we passed this
template a data context of some object that has a name field, boom, the name is in that header.


2. For each template you make, (which you make by just saying <template name="MYNAME"></template>), you then
define a bunch of things for the template, including but not limited to helper and events.

helpers are like template-wide variables that can fetch things for you from mongo collections or Session, which is
like a temporary dictionary for session-level information you want to keep track of but don't need to be writing to a
database.

events are just javascript hooks that you attach to things like form submission, clicks... any JS event for things

3. Prosper


Sidenote:
File organization is pretty lax in meteor. I started naming them based on their high-level view and what the user sees,
but you can split the files up however you like apart from some special meaning for the 'client' folder. Meteor reads
all the stuff in the home directory though very easily.
